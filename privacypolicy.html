<p>We take your privacy very seriously.

You further understand, acknowledge and agree that any personal information you provide on your Profile is in the public domain and is provided at your sole liability.

<p><strong>9. Premium SUBSCRIPTION FEES</strong></p>



<p>The basic version of the Services can be used completely free of charge. This includes basic learning courses and content. If you decide to advance your learning, we have a range of subscription options to best meet your needs. You can opt to subscribe for our monthly, yearly and lifetime subscription (together the “Premium”) to access advanced learning courses and content. Our fees for Premium are available to view in our Apps. Our Fees are subject to different subscription plans, gift plans and promotions, and we therefore reserve the right to update our Fees from time to time.</p>



<p>If you select Monthly Premium your subscription will automatically renew as a rolling subscription and renew at the end of each monthly period, being one month (or as near to the date as possible) from the date on which your Monthly Premium was activated. If you select Yearly Premium, your subscription will automatically renew as a rolling subscription at the end of each annual period, on the date on which your Yearly Premium was activated (each being a “Renewal”). If you proceed with a Renewal, the method of payment used to pay the Fees will be debited at the end of your current Premium subscription.</p>



<p>You acknowledge that, if we change the Fees, this will not affect your existing Premium subscription, therefore, if you have signed up for subscription at a certain Fee, any Fee changes will not affect any current subscription or any Renewals).</p>



<p>Please note that if you have purchased the subscription through Apple iTunes or iPhone/iPad application, the following conditions apply for renewals of Monthly and Yearly Premium subscription:</p>



<ul><li>Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period</li><li>your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.</li></ul>



<p>Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase.</p>



<p>The effect of the changes are as follows:</p>



<ul><li>From Monthly Premium to Yearly Premium – your Yearly Premium will be activated immediately after payment is processed and any time left on your Monthly Premium will be cancelled and will not be refunded;</li><li>From Yearly Premium to Monthly Premium – your Yearly Premium will continue to be active until the expiry of the remainder of your current Yearly Premium subscription and your Monthly Premium will be activated once your Yearly Premium subscription has expired; and</li><li>From Monthly Premium or Yearly Premium to Lifetime – your Monthly Premium or Yearly Premium will continue to be active until the expiry of the remainder of your current Monthly or Yearly Premium subscriptions and your Lifetime plan will be activated immediately after purchase. Please note that in case of switching to Lifetime plan,&nbsp;you have to cancel your Monthly or Yearly Premium subscriptions to avoid auto renewal of these recurring subscriptions.</li></ul>



<p>Your Premium subscription may start with a free trial. The free trial period for any subscription will last for the period of time specified when you signed up. Free trials may not be combined with certain other offers, as specified. If you begin your subscription with a free trial, the first billing day will be the day after the free trial expires. E.g for 7 day free trial the billing day will be the 8th day. However, no charges will be made if you cancel the subscription prior to the end of your free trial period. You may cancel your membership at any time by going to your account settings.</p>



<p><strong>10. CANCELLATION AND REFUND OF SUBSCRIPTION</strong></p>



<p>We do not provide refunds for Apple App Store payments, as those purchases are managed solely by Apple.</p>



<p><strong>11. DELETING YOUR ACCOUNT</strong></p>



<p>You can delete your account and terminate your use of the Services at any time by locating the ‘delete profile’ option in the settings section of your Profile. Once you have deleted your Account, your Licence will be revoked and you will no longer have access to your Profile and we will delete all of the information contained in your Profile. We accept no liability for deletion of information or content from your Profile. If you have an active Premium subscription when you delete your Account, you will not receive a refund for any time remaining on your Premium subscription.</p>



<p><strong>14. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong></p>



<p>You acknowledge and warrant that we, our officers, employees, contractors, suppliers, affiliates, agents and licensors are not and shall not be liable to you for any damages, including but not limited to loss of profit, inaccurate results, loss or corruption of Your Content or any data, data being inaccurate, the cost of recovering any data or Your Content, inability to access the Services, the cost of substitute services, claims by third parties for any damage to computers, software, modems, telephones or any other property, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, even where we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors and for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>



<p>The maximum aggregate liability of us to you in relation to any paid Premium Services (whether such liability arises in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty or otherwise) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, not exceed the total amount of the Fees paid by you to us for the Premium Services in the 12 months prior to the initial action giving rise to the liability, which is an aggregate limit that will not increase according to the number of claims brought by you. If no Fees have been paid by you and your use of the Services has been limited to the free Services, you shall not be entitled to any damages of any kind.</p>



<p>If you have a dispute with another User relating to, arising from, or in any way connected with use of the Services, you release us from all claims, demands and damages of any kind or nature arising out of or in any way connected with such dispute.</p>
