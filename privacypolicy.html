If you proceed with a Renewal, the method of payment used to pay the Fees will be debited at the end of your current Premium subscription.</p>



<p>You acknowledge that, if we change the Fees, this will not affect your existing Premium subscription, therefore, if you have signed up for subscription at a certain Fee, any Fee changes will not affect any current subscription or any Renewals).</p>

Please note that in case of switching to Lifetime plan,&nbsp;you have to cancel your Monthly or Yearly Premium subscriptions to avoid auto renewal of these recurring subscriptions.</li></ul>



<p>Your Premium subscription may start with a free trial. The free trial period for any subscription will last for the period of time specified when you signed up. Free trials may not be combined with certain other offers, as specified. If you begin your subscription with a free trial, the first billing day will be the day after the free trial expires.
